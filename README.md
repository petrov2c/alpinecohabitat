# AlpineCohabitat

## About the Project

AlpineCohabitat is an initiative to create a collaborative living environment in the French Alps, rooted in local history and sustainable development. Instead of pursuing greenfield development, the project prioritizes revitalizing existing buildings and historical sites to create a **harmonious blend of preservation and modern communal living**. 

The project draws inspiration from networked communities like Cabin.city and the Free State Project, aiming to bring together individuals who seek a balance between **self-sufficiency, shared resources, and meaningful social connection**.

This is more than just a coliving experiment; it is a long-term effort to **establish a thriving, self-sustaining habitat** where governance evolves with the needs of its members. The ownership model remains flexible—allowing for cooperative structures, land trusts, or other forms of shared or private ownership, as determined by the collective.

## Vision & Goals

- 🌿 **Sustainable, Nature-Integrated Living** – Settle in the Alpine region while preserving and enhancing its historical and natural heritage.
- 🏡 **Community-Centered Approach** – Create a space where people support and uplift each other through shared experiences and collaboration.
- 🔄 **Flexible Ownership & Participation** – Allow multiple governance models to coexist, accommodating a diverse range of community members.
- ⚡ **Resource Efficiency** – Maximize collective purchasing power for land and infrastructure through shared investment models.
- 🌍 **Scalable, Replicable Model** – Develop a framework that can support similar projects worldwide.

## Why the French Alps?
