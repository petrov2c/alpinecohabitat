# AlpineCohabitat Governance & Legal Structure

## 1. Introduction

### Why Collective Governance?
AlpineCohabitat is built on the premise that **a thriving, intentional community requires collective governance**. Unlike an informal group of individuals relocating independently to the same area, we are establishing a structured, cooperative approach to enable **smoother coordination, financial viability, and long-term sustainability**.

- **Avoiding Coordination Pitfalls:** Moving together without a shared governance model would be highly complexâ€”requiring individuals to align on property purchases, financing, and decision-making, which could easily lead to deadlocks, conflicts of interest, and high dropout rates.
- **Access to Funding & Development Opportunities:** A **collectively governed legal entity** allows us to access financing and funding options unavailable to individuals, as well as secure better terms for land acquisition and development.
- **Integration with Local Communities:** Instead of being perceived as **outsiders buying up property**, a cooperative structure ensures that our presence is rooted in **collaboration with local stakeholders**, fostering goodwill and mutual benefit.

### Purpose of This Document
This document outlines the governance model AlpineCohabitat will adopt, focusing on **decision-making processes, legal structures, membership models, and financial frameworks**. While a cooperative model appears to be the most viable option, we will explore alternative legal structures to ensure the best fit for our goals.

## 2. Governance Principles
### Core Values & Decision-Making
Governance within AlpineCohabitat will be guided by:
- **Autonomy & Participation** â€“ Members actively shape community decisions.
- **Transparency & Accountability** â€“ Open processes ensure collective trust.
- **Sustainability & Local Integration** â€“ Prioritizing ecological, economic, and social sustainability.

### Levels of Involvement
- **Resident Members** â€“ Actively living within the cohabitat, involved in governance & operations.
- **Non-Resident Members** â€“ Supporting members who contribute financially and engage in decision-making but do not reside full-time.
- **External Contributors** â€“ Experts, advisors, or local collaborators with limited decision-making rights.

### Decision-Making Model
- **Consensus-Based vs. Democratic Voting:** Exploring whether major decisions require full consensus or a qualified majority.
- **Leadership & Working Groups:** Delegating responsibilities through structured committees or rotating leadership roles.
- **Participatory Budgeting:** Allowing members to allocate community funds transparently.
- **Self-Organizing & Consultative Approach:** Encouraging members to take initiative while ensuring any proposed changes go through a consultation process with those impacted, fostering deeper engagement and understanding of the communityâ€™s needs.

## 3. Legal Framework Options
### Introduction
Choosing the appropriate legal framework is fundamental to the successful governance and sustainability of AlpineCohabitat. This section aims to clearly outline various legal structures, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in alignment with our community's vision. Through collaborative exploration and expert consultation, we will ensure the chosen framework effectively supports our community's governance principles, financial viability, and long-term goals.

### Potential Legal Structures
- **Cooperative (SCIC in France)** â€“ A flexible, community-driven model that allows shared decision-making and access to cooperative financing.
- **Association (Nonprofit)** â€“ A lighter legal framework focused on social and cultural initiatives rather than property ownership.
- **Private Land Trust/LLC Model** â€“ Ensuring long-term stewardship while allowing for structured participation.
