# AlpineCohabitat Engagement Plan

## Introduction

Engagement is fundamental to AlpineCohabitat’s success. This plan outlines how we will **attract, involve, and retain** members through different stages of the project. Engagement will evolve from an **early online-driven phase** to deepening **offline, real-world interactions**, ensuring trust and alignment before transitioning to governance, development, and operations.

A core principle of our engagement strategy is **projecting strong foundational values without limiting diversity**. Our early efforts will focus on finding like-minded individuals who resonate with the cohabitat’s goals while keeping the entry point accessible enough for those exploring the idea.

The **podcast** is envisioned as a key tool in Phase 1, helping to explore and communicate the **potential of building a community together** through interviews with people who have embarked on similar projects. It will also serve as a means for early supporters to share their stories, allowing others to connect with the vision on a personal level.

Throughout all phases, engagement will shift in focus—starting with **discovery and alignment**, progressing to **active participation and community-building**, and finally transitioning into **long-term sustainability and external knowledge sharing**.
