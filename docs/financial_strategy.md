# AlpineCohabitat: Financial Strategy & Funding Plan

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose & Scope
This document outlines the **financial strategy** for AlpineCohabitat, ensuring the project is both **sustainable and accessible** to its members. Our approach balances **member contributions, cooperative financing, and external funding sources** to support the acquisition, development, and operation of the cohabitat.

AlpineCohabitat presents an **alternative model** for property accessâ€”bridging the gap between **ownership and commercial holiday rentals**. It offers members:
- **Lower upfront costs** compared to buying a second home.
- **Elimination of personal property management burdens** like upkeep and security.
- **More flexibility** between short-term stays and long-term residence.
- **A sense of community and shared values**, making it more than just a holiday property.

The financial plan reflects these core goals, ensuring affordability and long-term viability.

## 2. Funding Phases & Sources

### 2.1 Pre-Acquisition & Engagement (Phase 2)
- **Short-term rental fund:** A rolling fund to book chalets for community engagement and area exploration.
- **Community funding:** Initial contributions to cover engagement events and preliminary site visits.
- **Potential sponsorships & grants:** Seeking external support for eco-tourism and cooperative housing initiatives.
- **Preliminary Property Analysis:** Encouraging members to explore listings on platforms like Leboncoin.fr and SeLoger to conduct initial assessments of potential sites for feasibility.

### 2.2 Acquisition & Development (Phase 3-4)
- **Member Contributions:** Each member (or household) contributes an upfront investment (~**â‚¬10,000+** per unit) to build initial capital.
- **Cooperative Financing:** Ethical banking, solidarity economy loans, or mortgage-backed financing.
- **Blended Funding Approach:** Aiming for a **1:6 to 1:7 ratio** of member capital to external financing.
- **Government Incentives:** Exploring eco-housing and rural development grants.
- **Estimated Development Costs:**
  - Expected acquisition and development costs in the Alps range between **â‚¬2,000-5,000 per mÂ²**.
  - Optimally structured **40mÂ² units**, with estimated costs between **â‚¬80,000-200,000 per unit**.
  - A rough financial model suggests that with **â‚¬1 million in community funding + â‚¬7 million in external financing**, we could develop around **40-100 units**.
  - Preliminary projections suggest **â‚¬100 per day in short-term rentals, at 60% occupancy, with 30% allocated for upkeep and management.**

### 2.3 Operations & Growth (Phase 5-6)
- **Resident Contributions:** Long-term members pay a cooperative rent, covering operational costs.
- **Short-Term Rentals:**
  - **Member discounts** for stays.  
  - **Market-rate rentals** for external guests to maximize revenue.
- **Community Services:** Hosting workshops, retreats, and eco-tourism experiences.
- **Reinvestment Strategy:** Revenue surplus supports maintenance, expansion, and debt repayment.
- **Flexible Housing Model:** Members can choose between long-term residence or short-term stays, with rental rates reflecting availability and cooperative commitments.
- **Sustainability Model:**
  - Members who stay long-term pay cooperative rent comparable to mortgage payments but below market price.
  - Members who do not use the property regularly contribute less but still have priority access to short-term rentals.
  - If no members claim a unit for a period, it can be rented externally at market rates to further offset costs.
  - **Rotational Residency System:** Long-term residency is granted for an initial **two-year period**. If no new applicants express interest after the first year, the residency may be extended on a rolling basis. If demand exceeds supply, priority is given to new resident applicants, ensuring circulation and access.
