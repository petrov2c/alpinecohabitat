# Governance Inspirations for AlpineCohabitat

This document captures core values, conceptual fragments, inspirations, and implementation triggers 
that inform the governance architecture of AlpineCohabitat. It is intended as a living document, 
allowing future contributors to trace the evolution of ideas and root structural decisions in their 
original intent.

## Core Values

### Diversity as Creative Force

> "We recognize diversity not only as a demographic reality, but as a foundational creative force.  
> Our governance approach prioritizes flexibility, distributed authorship, and collective self-presentation,  
> so that a wide range of people and perspectives can meaningfully shape the project.  
> We do not seek uniformity — we seek resonance.  
> Our structures should allow for natural affinities to form, express themselves, and interface with others  
> through transparent and voluntary coordination.  
> By designing for initiative rather than hierarchy, we aim to cultivate resilient networks of action,  
> capable of adapting in a changing world."

## Governance Fragments

### Tiered Group Model (15-member clusters)

- Groups are capped at ~15 to ensure fluid, offline self-organization.
- These clusters form the foundation of the organization.
- Clusters choose dynamic representatives who participate in the next tier.
- 3 tiers allow for scaling up to ~3000 members without top-down bureaucracy.
- Representatives rotate and are chosen based on initiative and energy, not fixed positions.
- Transparency of each group's work and values allows newcomers to find resonance.

### Collective Authorship and Group Self-Presentation

- Content and initiatives emerge from collaborative group work rather than individual branding.
- Groups maintain a visible presence to showcase their goals, culture, and projects.
- Transparency and openness are valued to promote initiative-based participation rather than dominance.

## Inspirations

- **Enspiral Network** — Dynamic roles, initiative-driven participation, fluid self-organization.
- **Sociocracy 3.0** — Tiered circles, double-linking representatives, autonomy + alignment.
- **Occupy Movement** (cautionary tale) — Consensus without structure leads to paralysis.
- **Mozilla Foundation** — The risk of over-democratization without decision frameworks.
- **Burning Man regionals** — Radical inclusion vs. fragmentation.
- **Russian Libertarian Party experiment** — Pushing against region-based rigidity in favor of affinity-based clusters.

## Ready When...

These concepts may become part of the formal governance structure once:

- At least two active groups (~15 members each) have formed and begun self-organization.
- There's a need for coordination between autonomous teams.
- Task clustering emerges organically and initiative-based leadership surfaces.
- A visible directory or dashboard of working groups becomes useful to onboard newcomers.

This document will evolve as AlpineCohabitat evolves. Every new idea, governance decision, or practical pattern 
can be added here to ensure coherence, traceability, and shared memory.
