## Executive Summary: AlpineCohabitat

### Vision & Mission
AlpineCohabitat aims to create an innovative community-driven model of property access, bridging the gap between traditional ownership and commercial rentals. Rooted in sustainability, community integration, and affordability, this initiative seeks to establish a cooperative habitat in the Alps, designed for flexible residential and holiday use.

Our mission is to offer members an accessible, sustainable, and community-centric alternative to second home ownership and short-term holiday rentals. Through collective ownership and shared governance, we aim to reduce individual financial burdens and ecological footprints while fostering meaningful social connections.

### Core Values
- **Sustainability**: Environmental responsibility, ecological preservation, and use of sustainable building practices.
- **Community**: Social integration with local communities, fostering strong internal member bonds, and collective decision-making.
- **Affordability & Accessibility**: Providing economically viable property access with minimal individual financial barriers.

### Project Overview
AlpineCohabitat will acquire and sustainably develop existing properties within the Alpine region, avoiding greenfield developments by revitalizing and adapting properties rich in local heritage and natural beauty. Members collectively finance the cooperative, significantly lowering individual costs and providing a stable, yet flexible residential or holiday solution.

### Financial Model
- **Initial Investment**: Members contribute an affordable initial fee (~â‚¬10,000 per household), leveraging external financing and cooperative funding.
- **Flexible Residency Model**: Members choose between long-term residence or short-term stays, with discounted rates significantly below market prices.
- **Revenue Sustainability**: The cooperative generates income through short-term rentals to both members (discounted) and non-members (market rates), along with community-driven eco-tourism and seasonal activities.

### Governance & Structure
The cooperative governance model emphasizes collective decision-making, transparency, and inclusivity, ensuring all members have an active voice in shaping community guidelines, property management, and future development.

### Current Status & Next Steps
The project is in the early engagement and planning phase. Immediate next steps include:
- Finalizing governance structures and legal frameworks.
- Engaging expert consultants specializing in cooperative real estate.
- Identifying potential sites in alignment with community criteria.
- Expanding member engagement through targeted outreach and community-building activities.

### Collaboration Opportunities
AlpineCohabitat is actively seeking collaboration and expertise from:
- Cooperative real estate experts and legal advisors.
- Sustainability and ecological planning specialists.
- Community-building consultants.
- Financial institutions interested in supporting innovative, sustainable real estate developments.

Join us in creating a sustainable, community-centered future for residential and holiday living in the Alps.
