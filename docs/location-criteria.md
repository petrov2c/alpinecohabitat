# AlpineCohabitat: Site Selection & Development Criteria

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose & Scope
Finding the right location for AlpineCohabitat is a **crucial step** in ensuring the long-term success, sustainability, and community integration of the project. The purpose of this document is to define the **core principles and flexible criteria** that will guide our search for an ideal site.

Rather than setting rigid, predefined requirements, our approach to site selection will be **dynamic and community-driven**. Through collective exploration, discussions, and offline activities in Phase 2, we will refine our vision by actively engaging with potential locations and learning from real-world interactions with landscapes, communities, and local stakeholders.

This document outlines both **fixed** and **adaptable** criteria, allowing flexibility to adjust based on available resources, local opportunities, and the evolving aspirations of the community. The goal is not only to find a place where people want to move but also to ensure that it resonates with our values and long-term vision.

## 2. Core Values & Guiding Principles

### Sustainability (Highest Priority)
- Ecological responsibility is central to our mission.
- Focus on minimizing environmental impact while supporting biodiversity and regenerative land use.
- Use of sustainable building methods and materials in any development process.

### Community Integration
- The project should enhance and integrate into the **existing social and economic fabric** of the region.
- Preference for locations where **local partnerships** (e.g., businesses, cultural initiatives) can be developed.
- Avoidance of isolationâ€”being welcomed by local residents is key to long-term sustainability.

### Accessibility & Infrastructure (Flexible Criterion)
- **Desirable but adaptable** based on available resources and community priorities.
- Some remoteness is acceptable, particularly if it enhances affordability and sustainability.
- Connectivity considerations (transport, internet access) should be evaluated **case by case**.

## 3. Site Selection Criteria

### 3.1 Natural Environment & Sustainability (Highest Priority)
- Preference for sites in the mountains, avoiding valley floors with overdevelopment risks.
- **Direct access to nature**: Ideal sites should offer easy entry to hiking, skiing, or other outdoor activities.
- **Water sources**: Proximity to rivers, streams, or other natural water features is highly desirable.
- **Climate considerations**: Seasonal balance, snowfall levels, and potential for year-round activities.

### 3.2 Community & Social Integration
- **Existing community dynamics**: Sites should allow for positive interaction rather than displacement of locals.
- **Cultural collaboration**: Opportunities to participate in or enhance local traditions, events, or initiatives.
- **Potential for economic exchange**: Possibilities for shared projects, employment opportunities, seasonal workforce demand, or complementary services that integrate with local industries.

### 3.3 Historical & Cultural Significance
- **Sites with heritage or historical elements** are preferable, particularly those with restoration potential.
- Adaptive reuse of an existing structure (e.g., watermill, farmhouse, former alpine inn) is ideal for maintaining authenticity.
- Preference for locations where history and modern sustainability approaches can be combined.

### 3.4 Location, Accessibility & Financial Factors (Adaptable)
- **Balancing remoteness and access**: The ideal site should feel immersed in nature while remaining logistically feasible.
- **Development potential**: Ability to secure necessary permits for restoration or low-impact construction.
- **Cost considerations**: Ensuring that acquisition and maintenance are within reasonable financial reach of the community.

## 4. Development Criteria

### 4.1 Sustainability & Environmental Impact
- **Passive design & energy efficiency**: Construction must prioritize renewable energy sources, insulation, and minimal waste.
- **Water and waste management**: Ensuring local water systems are respected and implementing sustainable sewage solutions.
- **Low-impact footprint**: New construction should be minimized, focusing on restoration and refurbishment where possible.

### 4.2 Architectural & Aesthetic Standards
- **Natural integration**: Buildings should blend into the landscape and complement local architectural styles.
- **Restoration over new builds**: Adaptive reuse of existing structures is strongly encouraged.
- **Eco-friendly materials**: Preference for timber, stone, and other low-impact materials.

### 4.3 Infrastructure & Community Amenities
- **Essential communal spaces**: Kitchens, workshops, shared gathering areas to foster interaction.
- **Connectivity infrastructure**: Feasibility of internet access for remote work, learning, and community management.
- **Housing flexibility**: Ability to accommodate a mix of full-time and part-time residents with adaptable spaces.

### 4.4 Community-Led Development & Participation
- **Collaborative planning process**: Members should be actively involved in shaping the final site plan.
- **Decision-making mechanisms**: Transparent systems for resolving conflicts and aligning on key development priorities.
- **Balance between individual and collective spaces**: Ensuring personal autonomy within a cooperative setting.

## 5. Decision-Making & Evaluation Process

### 5.1 Site Selection Pipeline
- Establishing **areas of interest** based on member feedback and exploratory trips.
- Collecting **submissions of potential sites**, ensuring key details are documented:
  - General description (location, landscape, surrounding infrastructure).
  - Property details (size, number of buildings, usable land area).
  - Legal aspects (ownership history, zoning, permit requirements).
  - Community connection (local engagement potential, personal ties of members to the area).
- **Multi-stage assessment** process:
  - **Initial review**: Community discussion and filtering of promising sites.
  - **Exploratory visits**: On-site assessments and engagements with local residents.
  - **Final evaluation**: Financial feasibility and compatibility with AlpineCohabitatâ€™s mission.

## 6. Next Steps & Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 2: Exploration**
  - Organizing hiking and exploration trips to potential areas.
  - Engaging with local communities to gauge openness and viability.
  - Establishing preferred geographic regions based on community feedback.

- **Phase 3: Shortlist & Evaluation**
  - Narrowing down to 3-5 potential sites based on experience and research.
  - Deeper due diligence, including financial feasibility assessments.
  - Legal consultations on acquisition pathways.

- **Phase 4: Acquisition & Development Planning**
  - Legal processes for securing land/buildings.
  - Developing architectural, financial, and logistical plans.
  - Initiating pilot residency programs to test site adaptability.
